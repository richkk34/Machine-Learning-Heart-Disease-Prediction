# Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health data. The goal is to demonstrate how simple ML models can support early diagnosis and decision-making in healthcare settings. The code is written in Python using a Jupyter Notebook format.

## Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. With the right data and tools, we can help identify individuals at risk early. This notebook walks through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using a supervised classification approach.

## Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed medical data
- Correlation analysis and feature selection
- Trained three models: Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest
- Evaluated models using accuracy and classification reports
- Visualized model performance for easy comparison

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas & NumPy for data handling
- Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for project organization

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset used is a version of the **UCI Heart Disease dataset**, which includes patient-level attributes like:
- Age, sex, chest pain type
- Cholesterol and blood pressure
- Fasting blood sugar and ECG results
- Heart rate and exercise-induced angina

> Note: The dataset was pre-loaded into the notebook. You can find the original version [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease).

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open it in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension.
3. Run each cell in order to:
   - Load the data
   - Explore and preprocess the dataset
   - Train and evaluate the models
4. Review the final model performance summary at the end of the notebook.
